Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.
For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].
Code in Python: 

k = "de"
S = ["dog", "deer", "deal", "edeeg"]
A = []
for i in range(len(S)) :
    if k == S[i][0:len(k)] :
        A.append(S[i])
print(A)
